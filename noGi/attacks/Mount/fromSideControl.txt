Gordon Ryan mount 1
FROM SIDE CONTROL TO MOUNT:
  1) ISOLATE THE ARM (12:58)
     A) same side shin pin: Gabriel grip his head, place your hips closer to his ,lift your hips and penetrate his arm with your shin. Pin it
     B) other side penetration and switch: if while doing A you notice he is super tight, instead of penetrating with the same side, penetrate with your other shin, bring your knees together and place your weight on his arm, pass the arm to the same side shin and recover guard frog position

  2) If he escapes by positioning the arm over your knee grab it with the arm pit and clinch for control
  3)  Use the shin mount:  Place your head on the ground for base
      Put your knee over his stomach and with your shoe laces MAINTAIN CONTACT with his outer leg just above the hip, so you can control better
      Use the motion of the knee on belly inner switch to complete the mount without giving half guard
