1. Gift Wrap grip, with HIS HEAD RESTING ON YOUR FOREARM
2. Elbows together, so he can't slip under
3. Both legs in front, having your elbow of 1 resting on your leg, wight less so you can pummel them for attacks

      - A) Kimura grip you already have
      - B) elbow v-grip with support on the triceps with your other arm. This is just grabbing his forearm with a v-grip (like and arm bar) and also grabbing his back of the elbow (inner part of the arm) with a monkey grip
   4. mMove your crossed leg to his upper hip and your bottom legs and shoe laces to touch his butt, apply pressure with the knee on his body so there can be no spaces for escape. At this point your knee and heel are touching and you are tight

Using your leg with knee connection to his body, apply force to your shoe laces connected to his butt and make a hip escape to readjust your attacking leg and place his head further into the triangle. The goal here is to further invert your attacking leg (8:10) (in other words point the attacking leg more to the sky)
