# Maintaining Mount

## Defending against hands  on chest and bridge  escape Gordon Ryan (Gordon Ryan mount vol 3 4:25) Never use this, bad escape
1. When he put one or both hands on your chest, scoop one of his elbow with your hand and push it, posture up and make base with your other hand
2. He will go on his side. At this point take your bottom leg and almost do a pone triangle, the point is to push his lower back with your free leg
   A) Release 1 and gift wrap him to take the back
   B) Recover mount with inside positions

## Control: lifting elbows (Gordon Ryan mount vol 3 7:50)
   He can have one or both elbows in the inside position with his back flat on the ground. We need to select the side which has less weight. If he only has one inside elbow, focus on that one
0. create space: on the other side of the elbow he has inside control put a base with your hand on the ground, you will tilt to this side to lift his attacking side shoulder
1. make a scoop grip on his shoulders and lift it little more with the help of your knee
2. Move your scoop grip from the shoulder to his elbow and break the inside position
3. Place your knee up in a one side high mount, make sure your knee and his elbow are at the same level


## Cross wrist grip
 ### Achieving Cross Grip (Gordon Ryann mount vol 3 16:00)
   When you are mounted with inside positions and he is defending his arms
   1. Go cross grip with palms face up
      You will Push the hand that is on bottom of the gabel grip
   2. Extend the arm that you will push with and push not with your arm force but with your body weight
   3. If he bridges, follow the bridge and switch the hand you are attacking for the one the bridge takes you too

 ### Countering Counter (Gordon Ryan mount vol 3 20)
   Cross wrist grip and he tries to elbow escape  
  1. Release the cross grip of the side that is not being attacked and double grip the one in danger (you know have a cross grip and a straight one on the attacking hand). release the cross hand grip and pass it behind his head and regrab. This will avoid him to move his elbow and displace your knee, since now he has l√≠mited range to move, because of the widget caused by your grip behind his head.
  2. switch to an s mount and achieve gift wrap
     - A)back take
     - B)recover mount:  with your free hand grab his elbow and move your head from center line to a side, this will help you take that elbow up.
  3. Flat him and  place your knee besides his shoulder
