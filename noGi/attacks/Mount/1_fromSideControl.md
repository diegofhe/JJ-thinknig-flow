# FROM SIDE CONTROL TO MOUNT:
## Isolating near arm:
  1) ISOLATE THE ARM (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 12:58)
     - A) same side shin pin: Gabriel grip his head, place your hips closer to his ,lift your hips and penetrate his arm with your shin. Pin it
     - B) other side penetration and switch: if while doing "A" you notice he is super tight, instead of penetrating with the same side, penetrate with your other shin, bring your knees together and place your weight on his arm, pass the arm to the same side shin and recover guard frog position

  2) If he escapes by positioning the arm over your knee grab it with the arm pit and clinch for control

  3) Use the shin mount:  Place your head on the ground for base
     Put your knee over his stomach and with your shoe laces MAINTAIN CONTACT with his outer leg just above the hip, so you can control better
     Use the motion of the knee on belly inner switch to complete the mount without giving half guard

     If he has a near arm isolated ( not with a frame on your hip) and want to use momentum to shift you (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1  27)
     When you are transitioning from shin mount to mount, you out all your weight to a side, he can use this momentum to roll you over with a bridge. The moment you see this
     1.  Go to a pseudo s mount but keep your body weight off his body, use your forehead and elbows to base and keep your front foot basing on the ground connected to his hip. He needs to stay FLAT IN THE GROUND, do not let him turn.
     2. Elevate your hips to they are not in contact with his body
     3. Use the leg behind his back (or behind his hips) to make a widget and counter the drag he will make

## Mount fallback (double unders and over under) Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 33)
### When to use it?
1. You ended in that position
2. You can't isolate the near arm using the side control legs isolation method 
3. He is an explosive player and will try to use momentum to turn you over

Steps:
1. Move your body to his hips and be close to them
2. Keep his far arm isolated with your forehead on the ground
3. Use your free arm to post his head and move yours from the far side to the near side

    - A) If he does not has his elbow glued to his side: underhook. Pass your arm through that space and flare both elbows to be above his shoulder line. You should have either clown gripping his shoulders or 10 finger grips between your hands
    
    - B) he has his elbow glued to his body: overhook. Grab his elbow or triceps and pull it to your body while you stand up basing with your outer leg. Grab his elbow with yours: place your hand on your tummy. This will make a strong elbow grip (like guillotine)


## Mounting without controlling the arms (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 42)
If you want to isolate the far arm but he is gluing his elbow to the ground
  1. move your arm doing the cross face over his face and place your elbow
     A) over his arm (she can bridge and unbalance you, maybe turning you)
     B) inside his arm (se can push and escape). He will cross face you to do this. You can always anticipate with an arm waiting and grab a Kimura grip )
  
  It really does not matter, just watch out for his options
  2. Move your hips to his head pushing he's arm
  3. Grab his leg and make him join his knee by pointing them to you
  
  - A) His near elbow is away from his body (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 44:45) 
    4. If feel your hips are inside his elbow, in the armpit, shoot your leg to mount .
    5. Move to a middle mount and has both your needs will be pressuring his armpit, this will avoid his "elbow escape"
  
  
  - B) His near elbow is glued to his body. You can't do A because he will either elbow escape or he will do an ankle trap (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 48:47)
    4. Take a step to start mounting, do not shift your body weight yet
    5. Reach under his but and grab his leg
       With the heel of #4 Digg  and place it on the back of his knees,  lift his leg with your arm and  grab both of his legs with the one digging.
    6. Go to both your knees (you will shift his hips from being in a side to the middle) and pass your other leg behind your
    7. know you have a mounted position with both feet protected, place one above the other and place them just below his butt so he cant trap them
