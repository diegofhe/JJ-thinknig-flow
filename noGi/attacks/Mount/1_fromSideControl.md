# FROM SIDE CONTROL TO MOUNT:
## Isolating near arm:
  1) ISOLATE THE ARM (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 12:58)
     - A) same side shin pin: Gabel grip his head, place your hips closer to his ,lift your hips and penetrate his arm with your shin. Pin it
     - B) other side penetration and switch: if while doing "A" you notice he is super tight, instead of penetrating with the same side, penetrate with your other shin, bring your knees together and place your weight on his arm, pass the arm to the same side shin and recover guard frog position
     
  From here you can attack

  2) If he escapes by positioning the arm over your knee, grab it with your arm pit and clinch for control. his arm will be shelves by your leg and armpit (like frog position)

        Use the shin mount:  Place your head on the ground   (same side your body is at) for base
        Put your soon to be outer knee over his inner stomach and with your shoe laces MAINTAIN CONTACT with his leg just above the hip, so you can control better (you have a pseudo knee on belly)
        Use the motion of the knee on belly inner switch to complete the mount without giving half guard
   
        If he has a near arm isolated ( not with a frame on your hip) and want to use momentum to shift you (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1  27)
        When you are transitioning from shin mount to mount, you put all your weight to a side, he can use this momentum to roll you over with a bridge. The moment you see this
        1.  Go to a pseudo s mount but keep your body weight off his body, use your forehead and elbows to base and keep your front foot basing on the ground connected to his hip. He needs to stay FLAT IN THE GROUND, do not let him turn.
        2. Elevate your hips to they are not in contact with his body
        3. Use the leg behind his back (or behind his hips) to make a widget and counter the drag he will make

## Mount fallback (double unders and over under) to mount Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 33)
### When to use it?
1. You ended in that position
2. You can't isolate the near arm using the side control legs isolation method 
3. He is an explosive player and will try to use momentum to turn you over

Steps:
0. you have the far arm isolated and are in side control (frog position)
1. Move your body to his hips and be close to them
2. Keep his far arm isolated with your forehead on the ground, with your far arm grab an underhook on his far arm
3. release the cross face and use that arm to post his head and move yours from the far side to the near side, once your head is position you need to do something with your now free hand (the one that was posting his head). for that you will see what he does with his not controlled hand (same side you are in)

    - A) If he does not has his elbow glued to his side: underhook (double under). Pass your arm through that space and flare both elbows to be above his shoulder line. You should have either clown gripping his shoulders or 10 finger grips between your hands
    
    - B) he has his elbow glued to his body: overhook. Grab his elbow or triceps and pull it to your body while you stand up basing with your outer leg. Grab his elbow with yours: place your hand on your tummy. This will make a strong elbow grip (like guillotine)


## Mounting without controlling the arms (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 42)
If you want to isolate the far arm but he is gluing his elbow to the ground
 1. move your arm doing the cross face over his face and place your elbow
     - A) over his arm (he can bridge and unbalance you, maybe turning you)
     - B) inside his arm (he can push and escape). He will cross face you to do this. You can always anticipate with an arm waiting and grab a Kimura grip )
  
  It really does not matter, just watch out for his options
2. Move your hips to his head pushing his arm
3. Grab his leg and make him join his knee by pointing them to you
  
 - A) His near elbow is away from his body (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 44:45) 
  4. If feel your hips are inside his elbow, in the armpit, shoot your leg to mount .
  5. Move to a middle mount and has both your needs will be pressuring his armpit, this will avoid his "elbow escape"
  
 - B) His near elbow is glued to his body. You can't do A because he will either elbow escape or he will do an ankle trap (Gordon Ryan mount vol 1 48:47)
   4. Take a step to start mounting, do not shift your body weight yet
   5. Reach under his but and grab his leg
       With the heel of #4 Digg  and place it on the back of his knees,  lift his leg with your arm and  grab both of his legs with the one digging.
   6. Go to both your knees (you will shift his hips from being in a side to the middle) and pass your other leg behind your
   7. know you have a mounted position with both feet protected, place one above the other and place them just below his butt so he cant trap them
