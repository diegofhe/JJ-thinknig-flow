## 3/4 recovery guard with NO CONTROL OF THE UPPER BODY (Gordon Ryan Mount vol 2 24:43)
Bottom guy achieve ankle trap and top guy is having his knee on the trap side on the ground, not yet in the half guard of the bottom guy, AND HE HAS FREE PROTECTED ELBOWS CLOSE TO HIS TORSO, READY FOR AN ELBOW ESCAPE

Bottom options
 - A) Put a hand through his legs achieving a deep half guard
 - B) Knee elbow escapes
   To avoid both 
     1. Move your free leg to the other side and sit on his legs. Both of his legs are now squashed by your weight
     2. Glue the trapped knee to his hips
     3. Place a widge with your hand on his back, gluing your elbow to his back. This way you have control over his movements

     5. If she still has inside position,
        A)use the knee on the hips to slide from his elbow to his hip
        B) cross face and flatten him so he can struggle with the elbow escape
        He can defend this option by doing a bicep widge, just grab by the elbow and pull.
     6. now he does not have inside elbow anymore and you are on 3/4 mount recover mount, from here you can do
      A) Near side underhook (Gordon Ryan Mount vol 2 32:25)
      B) double underhook

## 3/4 mount recover mount 

### - A) Near side underhook: (Gordon Ryan Mount vol 2 32:25) 
   Achieve inside position on his near arm, and grab an underhook, flare the elbow of the underhook to extend the partner and create space between his elbow and hips and put your fore-head on the other side of his head, base on the ground, pick up(lift your hips), take the free leg and insert a butterfly hook into his half guard and pass to mount

### - B) Double underhook (BEST OF ALL): (Gordon Ryan Mount vol 2 37) 
  while doing a) he can turn completely into you and free his shoulders and if he is an explosive guy this can lead to problems (there is back exposure, but not really because he can scoop the leg ). If that happens
   1. Use your head and shoulder to pin his shoulders to the ground
   2. With the help of your forehead on his biceps achieve double underhook
   3. Do A)
   
### - C) Far side underhook (Gordon Ryan Mount vol 2 41). Use this option if you can't grab the near side underhook.

  1. Use your head to push to his far shoulder
  2. Achieve an inside bicep widget on the far side, and transform it to an underhook
  3. If he is good at this point he is defending his near side arm with an spider guard. 
     Try freeing that hand to go either to a:
          - A) Cross face (vol 2 43:30): your free your hand and ended above his arm
               He can now do an elbow escape, so the second you achieve cross face pike up to pass
               If you can't free your arm from the spider guard, place  your face (mount 2 45:47) to the side of the arm and place your forehead to the ground. Use your shoulder to cross face him, pike up, somehow fight to free your hand and control it by grabbing his elbow
          - B) or a double underhook: you free your hand and ended below his arm, do the 'double underhook recover'

### D) Cross face only (Gordon Ryan mount vol 2 50:00)
  1. Achieve a cross face: he will be gluing his elbows to your leg to keep inside position
  2. Pass your hand all the way until his chin is on your shoulder and your finger is grabbing his armpit
  3. Pull him to you to flatten his back
  4. Flare your elbow to take his hands away from your legs
  5. He will accept the flat Back and start to fight for the elbow escape
  6. Place your forehead on the ground for base and put weight on your leg pressing his bottom one
  7. With the top leg achieve a butterly hook.
  
  - If he does not have inside elbow position:
     Pass
  - If he does have inside elbow position: 
     Free your bottom leg and place it over both of his and base with your outer leg (mount vol 2 51)
