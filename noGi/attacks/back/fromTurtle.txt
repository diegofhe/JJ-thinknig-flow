FROM CLOSED TURTLE (Danaher back vol 4 27)
1.- Hug him and grab his wrist,  with the same side leg cover his hip and butt with your inner leg part for him not to roll
2.- Put base with your other hand  look over his body while bloking with your knee (you will create some hip space for him to trip),
3.- Pull his hip to make him trip while you step back a little, HE WILL OPEN HIS ELBOW FOR BASE,
    ONLY IF HE DOES THIS CONTINUE (at this point you have one foot on the floor and one knee on the floor)
4.- Grab the seatbelt, lift your hips (now you have 2 feet on the ground) and with the leg that was on his butt ,make
    a widget on his elbow so he cannot close it
5.- You will have a base with your outside leg, use this one to grab his arm and go to the knees
6.- Roll through and finish
