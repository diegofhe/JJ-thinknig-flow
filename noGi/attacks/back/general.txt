You need to  keep control over him.
1.- Diagonal control: if you just have one hook and one arm, they must be on diff sides
2.- Head Trap: his head must be between my head and my arm always
    CLOSE CIRCUIT HEAD TRAP: put your hand behind his scapula
3.- Protect your hooks
      a) Lock a triangle
      b) POST REAR MOUNT: point your bottom leg upwards and place your top foot over his hip WITH PRESSURE

RECOVERING POSITIONS

LOWER HOOKS (StraightJacked vol1  1:03:00)
  IF YOU LOST THE LOWER HOOK and he is not over your knee
    1.- extend the leg to move the knee further
    2.  place your foot close to him (Just the foot not the knee)
    3.- Point the knee up and shift the weight

  IF YOU LOST THE BOTTOM KNEE (StraightJacked vol1  1:10:44)
    1.- Rotate your body face down, and extend both legs to maje your hips go up

    3.- PLace the knee that was lost into the armpit, at this time you still have your other leg between his, the hook
    4.- Use the hook to pull you opponent and recover the back
