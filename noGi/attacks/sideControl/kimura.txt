      3.- push your legs deeper and lock an initial CONTROL TRIANGLE, he will struggle, just control it

        1.- Extend the leg that is in contact with his armpit
        2.- Use that contact to pivot and rotate your hips so the back knee of the other leg is in contact with the neck

    FAILED YOKO SANKAKU TO KIMURA  (Gordon Ryan side control vol 3 32)
      If you can't achieve 4 because he is not naive and he is not letting you grab his elbow, go back to KIMURA

      1.- if we is defending the KIMURA grabbing his tights,  while keeping your arms figure 4,  address his grip by grabbing by the meat putting a leaver with your thumb on his wrist to make it bend and release
      2.- put his arm to the ground
      3.- unlock your legs and scissor them to rotate side putting your elbow on the ground.
      4.- finish KIMURA

      If any time he give you access to the tricep to finish yoko sankaku, finish it. The most posible scenario is that he release his tights and the grip his hands together
