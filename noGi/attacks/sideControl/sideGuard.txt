CONTROLLING (Gordon Ryan side control vol 2 20:21)
  If he wants to escape with the side guard (v shape connecting elbow to knee)
    NEVER DROP YOUR HIPS to counter the shrimps of the bottom guy at side control.
    ALWAYS WALK to the legs and start making his lower side go into his side. Also pinch with your elbow each small step you make

BREAKING (Gordon Ryan side control vol 2 25)
  GOALS:
    -Guy pinned goals: maintaining knee and elbow connection.  Elbow is always higher than the knee
    -Attacker doing the pin: separate knee and elbow connection by first putting the elbow lower than the knee, so your hips can enter the knee and break the connection

  1.- Walk  going up on the side control by doing two Little steps until you feel his forearm with your hips.
  2.- Drop your hips to make his elbow lower than the knee and expose It
  3.- Use the hips to push the knee and know go down on the side control position to control the legs, you end up almost  like his butt is  between your knees and he has his lower side on its side

HANDLING (Gordon Ryan side control vol 2 32)
  If you cannot separate the side guard with above logic,
    1.- Release the close grip
    2.- Place your top hand forearm in his hips, and with the arm closer to his knee,  put a widget on his knee
    3.- Place your head in the center line and lift your hips. Maintain head and chest contact always
    4.- Walk towards his hip to make his knee point out. The goal is to place your outer leg knee inside his flexed knees (remember at this point he has his legs in the side)
        lift your hips
