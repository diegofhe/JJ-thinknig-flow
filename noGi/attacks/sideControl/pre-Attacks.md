### ISOLATING ARMS (Gordon Ryan side control vol 3 5)

If he has both arms  in, you need to regain the far side arm control.

1. rotate the palm of your hand and retract your elbow to be on top on his stomach and penetrate between his forearm and belly
2. once In, rotate your arm and gain inside position (now he has the elbow pointing outside above your hand)
3. with the same arm turn it palm up (again) and penetrate through his arm and make a grip tangling your fingers
    MAKE HIM MOVE HIS ARM WITH YOUR ELBOW by placing it further away from you
4. use your head to isolate the arm and make him hug you (at this point you have normal Gabriel grip and his hand extended between your neck and your shoulder
5. avoid penetration of his arm by
    - Gluing the chin to his shoulders
    - Look at him and glue your ear to YOUR SHOULDER
      That will eliminate space

I WILL CALL THIS POSITION CONTROLLED SIDE CONTROL
