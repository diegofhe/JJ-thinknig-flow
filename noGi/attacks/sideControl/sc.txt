REVERSE CROSSFACE

  simply move your bottom arm of the Gabriel grip and put is in the throat, that will make his escape impossible, this is called
  Reverse CrossFace

  2.- He can continue looking at the ceiling, In this case go back to que Gabriel grip

V-GRIP
  1.- If he looks at your direction, he has not ditched the escape yet, just put the V Grip
    (grab his armpit with your hand, using the part between the thumb and index finger , the V)
     with your hand that is not on the throat and follow his movements closing the space between your hips

The reverse cross grip and v grip,  my chin need to be on his elbow and he needs to be on his back, the whole point is for his arm not to move and
place his head in your chest, if he base with his elbow, this is lost. Here you can go for Control or attack
  A)CONTROL - HIP CONTROL AND SHIN ON BELLY
    1) If he manages to go up into his lower elbow and base on it, you need to address the hips, put your shin on his belly and
    go to a shin on belly and push his hips to the ground

    2) Grab his inner tricep of the same side you are pinning his hip and mount him vol (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 35:47)

      PSEUDO HALF GUARD: What you need to do is to place your shin instead of on the belly on one leg pinning it
