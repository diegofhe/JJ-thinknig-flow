1.  Near and far arm isloated to prepare the shin mount 
2. This will cause your head to be on the ground doing base,  place your weight and base on your elbows, head and pin arm
3. Go shin mount on his closest hip
4. Slide your knee to touch your elbow , you can place it over your triceps almost like knee to the armpit if he struggle, for more control.
   across his stomach, with that you won't be trapped in side guard
5. step on his farthest hip and push his far arm even further to his face, so you generate space for 4 to go in
6. Lead your hips to his other shoulder (your hips almost wants to touch the ground) and pull the one you are attacking (like the Kimura initialization) to create even more space for 4. While doing this shoot 4 to his arm and place the back of your knee on his armpit
7. Lead forward so you can accommodate your down leg knee below his head, his head is not resting on your quad, penetrate deep until your knee touches your other leg (you will pass his far shoulder with that knee)
8. You can change grip to Kimura to stop him from exploting forward 
   If you can't move to Hankai Sankaku
9. Scoop around his head until you free you down leg. And straight it beside him. At this point you have a straight leg beside him and a triangle leg over his chest, still unlocked, your bodies are almost parallel, you on top
10. Keep scooping until the top knee touches the ground and lock the triangle. Here is where the Kimura stops him from continue rotating and escaping (you can do another triangle thou)

TO DO

# **Hankai sankaku** (Gordon Ryan side control vol 4 52:00)
If you are in position for ushiro SANKAKU and tries to stand up
 - A) step by step
   1. Use your knee to stop his roll when you are on your side and lock the initial triangle
   2. Grab his arm with your bottom arm.
   3.  and use the triangle knee to place it as a base on the ground in front of his chest on a v position relative to the ground. You will switch your hip placement to be on the side of his head
 - B) Use his momentum to roll with him
   You will end up in 3
   4. YOUR HIPS NEED TO BE ON THE AIR, AND ON THE SIDE, never fully up or down,( you are in a 45 degree angle ) this way he will never control your position, and you will control him
   5. Pull the arm and finish triangle pinching your knees together and doing a back heel
