No go escapes vol 8  19:16

From a chocke scenario
1.- Grab his choking hand elbow ( or gi ) with your arm on the same side.  placing the thumb of your other hand into his choking arm palm

2.- Don't fall, instead, while seated, slip yourself down, and pass his arm to the othe side of your head, while still grabbing
3.- Now go to the ground with the side you are on, you want to touch the ground with the back of your head
4.- Point your knees to the sky, release your hip and place it on his leg
5.- Elbow to the ground:  arch yourself to create space for the elbow to press the ground. At this point you are free of the back position
6.- guard yourself: achieve a butterfly hook with the leg  farthest to him. And do an elbow escape
