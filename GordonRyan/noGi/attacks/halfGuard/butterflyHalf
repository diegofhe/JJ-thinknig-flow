details on switching legs when leg trapped by weight (v1 1:06:14)

B2) cross ashi (v1 1:17:25)
  if you loose head position and can't get the arm
   - change the underhook for elbow frame in his chest and armpit hook
   - invert
   - release the frame and with the same hand scoop his near leg
   -pull him into cross ashi

to waiter to cross ashi (v1 1:27:25)

extend the legs and the the u motion. PUSH HIS SE HE LIFT THE HIPS ON THE SIDE YOU ARE HOLDING TO CONVERT IT INTO X, MAKE Reverse x to do a cross ashi attack

B) hip partner moves back and base

cross ashi dilema  (v1 1:30:50)
- change underhook to  chest frame and armpit hook
- change knee placement of the butterfly hook from outside and up to inside and across the waist, while keeping the butterfly hook 
 the goal of this is to make him take a hip to the ground, so really try doing this

push his upper body so he place the base hand behind his shoulder line

use your face as base and then semi- invert making you closest knee touch your deep half underhook hand, but it does not touches the ground

  B.A) butterfly hook leg cross ashi (your top leg) 

      B.A.a) he pushes (V1 1:31:21)
    complete the inversion and pull to cross ashi 

     B.A.b) he fall to the hips (V1 1:31:44)
     put yourself above his hips and step backwards into cross ashi. NOTE: YOU NEED TO FALL WOTH YOUR HIPS ON TO THE FLOOR OF YOUR BACK SIDE

you can also force B.A.b by grabbing the Shoe laces instead of the leg scoop and pulling to force sitting (V1 1:32:15)


  B.B) half guard leg cross ashi (your bottom leg) (V1 1:37:15) the difference to B.A is that you release the butterfly hook and place both knees to the ground. at this point you are kneeled sitting in one of your partner legs controlling it with your inside arm (from inside to outside). your head should be placed as a tripod
    B.B.a) he pushes while getting up to make  space (V1 1:40:50)
     -at this moment switch the hand controlling his leg to your outside hand (from outside to inside and open your inside knee to make space for your head
     - place your head in the middle of the 4 legs and catch his other leg in the same way
     - roll and complete the cross ashi
   B.B.b)he stays or goes back (V1 1:43:30)
      -push him back to a hip
      -switch hands from inside arm ( inside-out) to outside arm ( outside-inside) SCOOP
