# DEFENDING THE FAR SIDE WRESTLER ESCAPES (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 29)

### CONCEPTS
- **REVERSE CROSSFACE**
  1. When you are pinning and his hand that defend the throat penetrate inside your arms he is going for a wrestler escape,
  simply move your bottom arm of the Gabriel grip and put is in the throat, that will make his escape impossible, this is called
  Reverse CrossFace
  2. He can continue looking at the ceiling, In this case go back to que Gabriel grip

- **V-GRIP**
  1. If he looks at your direction, he has not ditched the escape yet, just put the V Grip
      (grab his armpit with your hand, using the part between the thumb and index finger , the V)
      with your hand that is not on the throat and follow his movements closing the space between your hips

The reverse cross grip and v grip,  my chin need to be on his elbow and he needs to be on his back, the whole point is for his arm not to move and
place his head in your chest, if he base with his elbow, this is lost. Here you can go for Control or attack

### CONTROL
- **HIP CONTROL AND SHIN ON BELLY**  
  1. If he manages to go up into his lower elbow and base on it, you need to address the hips, put your shin on his belly and
    go to a shin on belly and push his hips to the ground
  2. Grab his inner triceps of the same side you are pinning his hip and mount him vol (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 35:47)

      - **DEFENSE TO SHIN ON BELLY MOUNT**  
        He needs to change from the under hook to an inside frame (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 37:35) use the momentum to go between your legs and attack in a half guard fashion (To Practice) 
      
        -  **PSEUDO HALF GUARD:** What you need to do is to place your shin instead of on the belly on one leg pinning it
          A) Use your Upper body to put him flat on the ground (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 38:40)
          B) Mount: with the elbow pinning his elbow to his belly, put it inside the outer leg to control his hip movement and switch from a leg pin to place your knee ON HIS ARM PIT  to avoid half guard

### ATTACKS
- **KIMURA:** (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 43)  
     - you are with a CROSSFACE and V-grip and he tires wrestler escape:  
       1. control his triceps and pinch his arm with your elbow
       2. Pass your hand through his isolated arm and form the kimura triangle
       3. He will try to release his arm by pulling and rotating, you need to secure the kimura 
  
     - If he lifts his hips  to try to body lock you (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 46)  
       1. Make base with you outer leg by stepping on the ground
       2. Put your inside leg quadriceps (same side that the arm that is penetrating is in) in touch with your elbow and use the butterfly hook in
       3. With your other leg, step into the ground and do a shrimp while pushing the guy back into side control with kimura 
            If he wants to hop your sweep, place use a high knee and wait until you can finish the sweep
     
     From here you have 2 options
     A) Put your elbow on the ground and your body weight in his chest
     B) Fall jumping over his face to end up above his head in a "T" form you being the top and he the bottom ( T kimura)

- **INVERTED KATA GATAME (DARCE):** (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 51)  
  Ideal Scenario: As the partner is going for the wrestler escape, before he elevates his body and put base on the elbow, he is on his side
  1. Shoot the hand that is doing a V-grip all the way trapping his arm Your clavicle need to touch his ribs and your shin is over his armpit, your hand is going to pop up below his neck
  2. Grab that hand with your other hand doing a finger interlocked grip if he wants to get up, push his head to his chest and make him fall again  (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 51:45)

- **Guillotine** (Gordon Ryan side control vol 1 1:01)
  1. Shoot the V-grip into the neck trapping his arm (like a Darce), place yourself and weight on top of the partner,
           trap his head with the other arm so you can place a guillotine as you fall
  2. As he goes up, you will fall to the side and Switch the weight focus  on the bottom shoulder,
     your nose need to be touching that shoulder, that will deepen the guillotine position
  3. Once both fall, throw him to the ground using a butterfly hook (the head and shoulder connection served his purpose and is no longer necessary) If you can go to the mount
