# He has inside positions 
<hr>

## Try a Kimura (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 11:58)
His goal is to do a bridge to push you and move you until your stomach is on his head

The defense:  In any moment on the flow The moment you feel this open your leg closer to his head to put a wide base,
step into the ground and push your body and your head to his stomach avoiding his goal

1. Release your under his head grip and go over his head and place that elbow in front of his shoulder now you have both elbows on the same side (frog position)

2. With the arm of 2 grab his triceps with the v-grip created by your forearm and arm

3. With your hand closer to his hips, pass it by your stomach and extend it until you touch his hips (should be across his body). You want this frame for you to move to north south if he escapes .

4. You want base here since you will start attacking, do the defense movement (explained above) to gain base with your extended leg. Your head and shoulder are pressing his hips to avoid his inner position with the legs
   With the arm that is on his hips, make it palm up and  fold it to enter t o your stomach area from below you.

   Penetrate the arm you are grabbing with the v grip and grab his wrist

5. Pull his hand below his elbow. Use that grip and your chest to push this elbow away from his torso and secure the Kimura grip
<hr>

## When to move to North south (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 20)
1. He has a knee in the inside position or is starting to point his knees to do this
2. You are losing control over the head
3. He is turning into you to escape, for example the wrestler escape

### Moving to North south
The hand closest to his hip will move to make the back of that hand touch his outer hip (we will call this bottom hand)
Maintain the cross grip on his head to counter the turning (this hand is the top hand)

If he is turning to you (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 25:54)
1. Place the bottom hand first
2. Use the cross grip to counter the turning. The place it above his head and shoulders

The most important thing is the head position. (Vol 5 27), when you are transitioning glue your head to his hip and listen to his leg thoughts. ALWAYS maintain your body weight ok top of his chest with this


### CONTROLLING NORTH SOUTH
### HIGH TRIPOD (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 29:44)
you need to put your head to
A) center of his hips
B) to the side pushing his hips with your shoulder and listening to the leg

The main defense of the north south is to connect knee and elbow. You will use your head position and bodyweight to stop this by lifting your hips and going to a high tripod

## Defending North South counter

### Defending one leg entry (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 32)

If he manages to connect elbow and knee on one side
1. Put your forehead on his other leg and put resistance so he does not enter with that one too
2. Have a loose shoulders, if he pushes with the one already in and you have stiff shoulders it will push your whole body and create space, if you have loose shoulders we will lift just your arm

3. You want to break his knee elbow connection
   - A) if he lets you have the inside position: place your hand between his connection and touch his ribs (inside position). Once the inside position of your hand is achieve, make the shoulder have inside position too, lowering it and putting his knee above your shoulder. push your shoulder to break his connection
   - B) if he does not let you have the inside position (vol 5 34). Penetrate instead from his armpit, here you will

           - A) falling to his head: (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 36)
               1. Use your head and body do put his hip in which he has the  frame to the ground
               2. Put your knee behind his head, on his neck and move to side control
           - B) self frame (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 37)
               To avoid A) he will put a self frame to avoid falling. This will make space for you to gain the inside position , and with that the controlled north south

### Defending 2 legs Inside (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 40)

- A) you can penetrate his knee and elbow connection by introducing your arm
    1. Move from side to side (making him move too) in a rocking motion, do a couple and then either extend his legs o push it away so you can penetrate with your shoulder
    2. See the "defending one leg entry"
- B) you can't introduce your arm (vol 5 43)
    1. Grab his ankles and push to keep his legs flexed
    2. Stand up and keep his head between your legs, if he move you move
    3. Move him side to side to make his knee separate and penetrate when you can with your elbow first and then with your head
    4. Try pummeling one arm and recover inside position
   
- C) He turns (Gordon Ryan side control vol 5 48)
    - A) His head is between your knees, you want the back
       1. Place the knee facing his back further in
       2. Put that side elbow across his body and place it to the ground, you are now hugging him

       2. Back step and put your hips on the ground next to him. While you do this he will try to make and underhook, crush it with your hips and weight
       3. He will put base on his elbow to lift his body, grab a tight waist (high his wrist, put your elbow to the ground ,
          with the sauce he created on 3 grab deep into his wrist, your forearm will be under  him)
          - A) If he does not block the cross face: put him to the ground
          - B) if he blocks the cross face by releasing his top arm. Place your forehead into his armpit and grab his head with the normal side control grip (under his neck)  with your palm in his scapula
